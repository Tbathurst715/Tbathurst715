//In this homework assignment we had to

1. add img descriptors to each image.to insure it follows accessibility standards.
2. Make sure the code has semantic elements.
3. Ensure the elements follow a logical structure.
4. Make sure the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
5. When the title element is viewed then it is a concise descriptive title.

As you will see I have completed each of these. I changed many ov the DIV elements to either
main, section, aside or footer. Each Img has a description that is related to the image.
I arranged the code so that I could make sure that it followed a logical structure.
I changed the headings all so they were numerically consistent.
I changed the title element so that is it described well.
